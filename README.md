Graduation Thesis for Data Science in Economics and Business - NEU
### Structure of the Thesis
The thesis consists of five chapters:

    \item Chapter 1: Literature Review. We review basic concepts of Uncertainty and the theory of Bayesian Neural Networks. Some approaches to the insurance claim cost prediction problem and challenges are provided.
    \item Chapter 2: Bayesian Neural Networks. In this part, we review traditional neural networks, the necessity of quantifying uncertainty, some types and approaches to uncertainty, and the theoretical basis of Bayesian Neural Networks. Some examples are included to emphasize the advantages of models.
    \item Chapter 3: Methodology. We introduce the problem and dataset and present the pipeline of analysis and models.
    \item Chapter 4: Data Analysis and Results. We conduct exploratory data analysis to analyze and investigate the dataset and show the results of the models.
    \item Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Research.
