Contains:
### 1. Notebook
* Use a dataset in Kaggle: Actuarial Loss Prediction competition.
* Compare 3 models predicting the ultimate cost:
  * Neural Network
  * Bayesian Neural Network
  * Generalized Linear Model
### 2. Thesis

The thesis consists of five chapters: 

* Chapter 1: Literature Review. We review basic concepts of Uncertainty and the theory of Bayesian Neural Networks. Some approaches to the insurance claim cost prediction problem and challenges are provided.
* Chapter 2: Bayesian Neural Networks. In this part, we review traditional neural networks, the necessity of quantifying uncertainty, some types and approaches to uncertainty, and the theoretical basis of Bayesian Neural Networks. Some examples are included to emphasize the advantages of models.
* Chapter 3: Methodology. We introduce the problem and dataset and present the pipeline of analysis and models.
* Chapter 4: Data Analysis and Results. We conduct exploratory data analysis to analyze and investigate the dataset and show the results of the models.
* Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Research.
